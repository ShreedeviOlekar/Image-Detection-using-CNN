Here, we disseminate a new handwritten digits-dataset, termed Kannada-MNIST, for the
Kannada script, that can potentially serve as a direct drop-in replacement for the original
MNIST dataset. In addition to this dataset, we disseminate an additional real-world
handwritten dataset (with images), which we term as the Dig-MNIST dataset that can serve
as an out-of-domain test dataset. We also duly open source all the code as well as the raw
scanned images along with the scanner settings. We provide high level morphological
comparisons with the MNIST dataset and provide baselines accuracies for the dataset
disseminated. The initial baselines obtained using an oft-used CNN architecture ( for the
main test-set and for the Dig-MNIST test-set) indicate that these datasets do provide a sterner
challenge with regards to generalizability than MNIST or the KMNIST datasets. We also
hope this dissemination will spur the creation of similar datasets for all the languages that use
different symbols for the numeral digits.
